# This is for the MPI-parallelization of the SCF + NSCF steps.
# For optimal efficiency the number of MPI procs should be a multiple of the number of k-points nkpt.

# Definition of the k-point grid for electrons.
# Roughly speaking, GW computations scale with N_k^3 with N_k the total number of points in the mesh.
# All the four steps must be done with the same value of ngkpt
# Here I use even divisions so that I can run the sigma part without having to change kptgw.
